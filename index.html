<p>Course Description:</p>

<p>DLCL 202: FROM MESSY DATA TO BEAUTIFUL VISUALIZATION
Humanities research in the digital age relies increasingly on digitized source material. Working with texts and archives as data opens up opportunities to observe and discover both general patterns and punctual facts through visualization. Visualization not only helps us present arguments about data, but helps readers engaging critically in the content. But we cannot build data-driven visualizations without first understanding how data came to be data and what we can do with it. This is a course for the aspiring data humanist. We will apply techniques for inspecting, transforming, enriching, and versioning data, collaborating around data, and creating effective visualizations. The course is targeted to students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students new to data-driven research. All of our course meetings will take place in the lab at CESTA (Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis) and involve hands-on computing work. Students will be expected to participate in all sessions and present a final data-driven visualization project. There are no prerequisites for the class and the class is open to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates.</p>
