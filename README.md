# From Messy Data to Beautiful Visualization

This is the repository with syllabus and materials for a course taught by Nicole Coleman and Glauco Mantegari at Stanford University in Spring 2013 as part of the Humanities+Design program.

Herein you'll find the syllabus and any course materials we distributed. Most students brought their own projects and data to the class.
